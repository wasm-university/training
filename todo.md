Compared with Linux containers, WebAssembly could be 100x faster at startup, have a much smaller memory and disk footprint, and have a better-defined safety sandbox. However, the trade-off is that WebAssembly requires its own language SDKs, and compiler toolchains, making it a more constrained developer environment than Linux containers. WebAssembly is increasingly used in Edge Computing scenarios where it is difficult to deploy Linux containers or when the application performance is vital.


Application frameworks support WasmEdge as an embedded function or plug-in runtime. We will cover streaming data framework YoMo and Go function schedulder / framework Reactr.
